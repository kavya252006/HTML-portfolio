<h3>The Amazing spider man-2</h3>
<p>This Movie was a great deal for me. It was the most fine in terms of VFX. </p>
<h3>Munjha</h3>
<p>I recently watched this movie. This is a horror movie containing okiesh VFX with some really ghoosebumps giving scenes.</p>
<h3>Satyaprem ki katha</h3>
<p>This movie was my all time favourite in terms of romantic genre. It touches my heart because it depicts the culture of gujarat with gujarati accent in it. </p>
